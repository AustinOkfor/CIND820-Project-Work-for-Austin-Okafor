DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS:


Missing information and unknown values were entered as -99 and -88 respectively. These need to be replaced with NA so as not to distort the analysis outcomes.


## Importing the dataset and converting -88 and -99 into NA's since these represnt missing data in the dataset

```{r surveyDataset}
#-99 and -88 represent missing or unknown values in the dataset. We need to set them to NA when importing the data.

mna <- c(-99, -88)

dssDataset <- read.csv("developmental_services_survey_dataset_0.csv", 
                       header = TRUE, 
                       stringsAsFactors = F, 
                       na.strings = c(mna,"NA"))

head(dssDataset)
```


The first column (UID) is just the numbering of the data collected. This is not required and needs to be removed.

```{r dssData}
#Removing the UID column as it represents numbering

dssData <- dssDataset[ ,-1]

head(dssData)

```



Checking for the structure of the dataset to see the various data types and confirm correctness


```{r}
#Checking variables attributes

str(dssData)


```

# This reveals there are 33615 records in our dataset and that all the categorical variables are stored as integers, and PR_QQ is stored as a character variable.
# We will need to fix these.

```{r}
# Changing PR_QQ to numeric data

dssData$PR_QQ <- as.numeric(gsub(",","",dssData$PR_QQ))


str(dssData)

```



Now we check for count of missing data in each column of the dataset. The aim of this process is to determine which columns we may need to drop due to inadequate data.

```{r}
#Checking NA count for each column

colSums(is.na(dssData))

```


Now we will prun down the data by dropping columns with 10,000 0r more NAs.

```{r}

#dropping columns with 10,000 or more NAs

dssData2 <- dssData[ , colSums(is.na(dssData)) < 10000]


colSums(is.na(dssData2))

str(dssData2)

#this process leaves us with 37 columns from the initial 75.

```


Prunning down rows with 5 or more NAs

```{r}
# dropping rows with 5 or more NAs

dssData3 <- dssData2[rowSums(is.na(dssData2)) < 5, ]

str(dssData3)

# this process leaves us with 26732 rows from the initial 33615

```


Since all the remaining columns represent categorical variables, we will now convert all variables to factors

```{r}
# Converting all variables to factors

col_names <- names(dssData3)
dssData3[,col_names] <- lapply(dssData3[,col_names] , factor)


str(dssData3)

```


Now let us examine a possible relationships between epilepsy, seizures or convulsions cases and acquired brain injuries reported.

```{r}

sub_Data1 <- table(dssData3$PR_QN1_G, dssData3$PR_QN1_H) 


sub_Data1

# This result suggests that: 
#373 patients were diagnosed for both Epilepsy, seizures or convulsions and Acquired brain injury.

#70 patients had both Epilepsy, seizures or convulsions and Acquired brain injury but have not been diagnosed yet. This represents a portion of people who may have suffered brain injury as a result of not receiving proper care for their Epilepsy, seizures or convulsion condition. It also represents the number of people who may not have been able to receive required services for their condition.

```


Plot a Bar chart of service type received

```{r}
# Barplot of service type received

data <- table(dssData3$SERVICES)

data

barplot(data, xlab = "Service Type", ylab = "Frequency", col = c("red","blue","green"), main = paste("Histogram of", "Type of Services Received "), legend.text = c("Residential","Non-residential","Both"), args.legend = list(x = "topleft"))

```


Boxplot

```{r}
# Creating a Boxplot for services and all other service related data

dss <- dssData3[ ,c("SERVICES","PR_Q3D","PR_AGE1","C_QS1","C_BEHAVETHER","C_AUDIOSPEECH","C_COMMCONSUL","C_PT","C_OT","C_DIETICIAN","C_PSYCHIATRIST","C_PSYCHOLOGIST")]

boxplot(dss,
        main = "Services Rendered With Other Service Types, Age, and Sex", 
        at = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12),
        names = c("SERVICES","PR_Q3D","PR_AGE1","C_QS1","C_BEHAVETHER","C_AUDIOSPEECH","C_COMMCONSUL","C_PT","C_OT","C_DIETICIAN","C_PSYCHIATRIST","C_PSYCHOLOGIST"), 
        border = "brown", xlab = "Values", horizontal = TRUE, las = 1.5)

```


## Plot of subset of data

Creating a Plot of the subset created to check for any correlation relationships between the variables for services rendered.

Since hese are categorical variables, no relationship is expected.

```{r}
# Plot of Service types as specified in the data dictionary

sub_dssData <- dssData3[ , c("SERVICES","PR_Q3D","PR_AGE1","C_QS1","C_BEHAVETHER","C_AUDIOSPEECH","C_COMMCONSUL","C_PT","C_OT","C_DIETICIAN","C_PSYCHIATRIST","C_PSYCHOLOGIST")]


plot(sub_dssData)


# No visible relationship appears to exist between any of the variables.

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
