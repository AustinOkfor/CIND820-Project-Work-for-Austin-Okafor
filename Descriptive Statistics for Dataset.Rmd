## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS:


Missing information and unknown values were entered as -99 and -88 respectively. These need to be replaced with NA so as not to distort the analysis outcomes.


## Importing the dataset and converting -88 and -99 into NA's since these represnt missing data in the dataset

```{r surveyDataset}
#-99 and -88 represent missing or unknown values in the dataset. We need to set them to NA when importing the data.

mna <- c(-99, -88)

dssDataset <- read.csv("developmental_services_survey_dataset_0.csv", 
                       header = TRUE, 
                       stringsAsFactors = F, 
                       na.strings = c(mna,"NA"))

head(dssDataset)
```


The first column is just the numbering of the data collected. This is not required and needs to be removed.

```{r dssData}
#Removing the UID column as it represents numbering

dssData <- dssDataset[ ,-1]

head(dssData)

```


Checking for the structure of the dataset to see the varius data types and confirm correctness

```{r}
str(dssData)

```


Running summary command to see mean, median and percentiles.

```{r}

summary(dssData)

```


Plot a histogram of Service type rendered

```{r}

hist(dssData$SERVICES, 
     main = paste("Histogram of", "Type of Services Received "), 
     xlab = "Service Type", col = "blue")

```



Creating a Subset of the dataset to be used for additional analysis

```{r}

sub_dssData <- dssData[ ,c("SERVICES", "PR_AGE1", "PR_Q3D", "PR_QQ", "PR_QM1A", "PR_QL1", "PR_QK1", "PR_QF1A","PR_QG1A","PR_QH1A","PR_QI1","PR_QJ1")] 

head(sub_dssData)


```



## Plot of subset of data

Creating a Plot of the subset created to check for any relationships between the variables in the subset

```{r }

plot(sub_dssData)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
